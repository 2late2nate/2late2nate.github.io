## Hello world!

As I write this post, I am currently editing, organizing, and customing all of the website's files in VSCode. And I have no idea what I'm doing!

While I know a decent amount of HTML and CSS, this is my first time ever trying out Jekyll. So, to have an easier time figuring out what does what, I used ronv's template, sidey, since I liked the minimalistic and organized design. I may end up making my own template one day, though.

**To do list for the site**
- Remove RSS feature,
- Change color palette,
- Create credits page
- Properly fill out about page.

Here's to hoping that all goes well. o7
