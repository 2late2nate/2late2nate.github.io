<p>Even as a Filipino currently residing in the Philippines, I barely know how to speak in what <em>should</em> be my native language. Instead, I usually resort to English for my day-to-day interactions both online and offline.</p>

<p>It feels shameful in retrospect. I can’t help but feel like I’m disappointing those who came before me, or <em>worse</em>, accepting what the colonizers <strong>would’ve</strong> wanted (which is.. a really silly thought, but it gnaws at me nonetheless). I eat my ancestors’ food, live on their land, and I can’t even bother to accept and appreciate their culture? That’s not very <strong>fair</strong>, is it?</p>

<p>Not to mention the lack of connection… How can I ever connect to other Filipinos if we can’t speak the same language?</p>

<p>So, I plan on fixing that.</p>

<p>I don’t have a very solid gameplan just yet, as I plan on winging it depending on my needs and circumstances, but <em>just</em> for today, I’ve picked up a textbook and completed the very first lesson.</p>

<p>It didn’t make me feel any kind of strong emotion, nor did I feel notably proud of myself, but I did end up feeling fulfilled. Like I’m actually <em>doing</em> something with my life for once. I’m happy with that.</p>

<p>Maybe I might even start learning languages as a hobby— not out of necessity or practical reasons, it’d be just for fun. I’m thinking of picking up Swedish once I’m comfortable enough with this process of learning. Mostly because of music reasons. &lt;—(Metalhead. [Derogatory])</p>

<p>I’ll let you all know how it goes.</p>

<p>I am currently typing this post in VSCode, right after a few days of wrestling with my terminal and Jekyll itself to get it to finally work… And I’m not very experienced with using my terminal nor Jekyll just yet, so you can imagine how torturous the entire process was. I did manage to learn a lot of things though. I have no regrets when it comes to that.</p>

<p>I’m already decently experienced in HTML and CSS, so setting up the code for that was no problem. When it came to Liquid and linking all these pages together using something other than relative and absolute links, however, I had a lot of problems. But, with the help of the Jekyll docs, I was able to make something that just <em>barely</em> functioned. Hell yeah.</p>

<p>I don’t have much else to say, really.. All I plan to use this blog for is to document my journey in learning new programming languages, the development of this site itself, and other things I deem professional or formal enough to be placed here, instead of any of my social media pages. I’ll end this blogpost with a quick to-do list for this website, and I’ll be signing off. I might make that a habit for all of my blogposts, actually.</p>
