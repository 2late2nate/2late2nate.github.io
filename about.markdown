<h2>About: The Webmaster</h2>

Hi, I'm **Nate**, and I'm an aspiring programmer. It's nice to meet you.

For the time being, there's no proper way to contact me, as I prefer to keep to myself and my privacy. Maybe check back in a few years.

<h2>About: The Website</h2>

While I established this 2late2nate earlier, I consider this website to have been made on June 18th, 2025, as it is the date I started truly working on it.

As said on the homepage, 2late2nate is home to all of my **blogposts** and **professional work** here, and acts as a way for me to learn web development and web design.

2late2nate is open source, and all of its code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/2late2nate/2late2nate.github.io), and further credits can be found in the [links](links.html) page.


<h2>Projects</h2>
- **Work on Github Pages site**
  - Create portfolio page
